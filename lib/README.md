# Project: Labradoodle or Fried Chicken? 

### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

In our project, lib/test.R and lib/train.R include the model training process, and lib/feature_extraction folder include our feature extraction process, in Python language.
